    <h1>What do we do at the workshops?</h1>
    <h2>Make friends</h2>
    <p>
      As much as it's about coding, our workshop is also about bringing people
      together. And we believe when people come together and share some
      experience, magic can happen.
    </p>
    <h2>Help each other</h2>
    <p>
      It's never just about ourselves. At our workshops, you might learn
      something a little faster and you can help out those around you, and when
      you struggle with something else, others come and help you out too. We are
      all in this together and we never leave anyone behind.
    </p>
    <h2>Learn coding</h2>
    <p>
      Coding is fun and rewarding. Just like a craft workshop, after a fun and
      creative afternoon, you will bring home some cool work to show your family
      and friends. Come try it out if you don't believe me.
